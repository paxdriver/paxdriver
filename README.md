UPDATE 04/2022: Starting a youTube channel of the same name "paxdriver" to begin a development vlog chasing the proverbial dragon of achieving machine learning general artificial intelligence. Although the goal may be lofty, the approach itself is the primary focus of my research. I'll be using 3D graphics engines to develop, train and analyze implementations on my AI algorithm. I'll be posting samples of progress and teaching materials to this github so be on the lookout for supporting documentation linked from the youtube channel once I start posting videos.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @paxdriver, co-host and producer of the "Frivolous Gravitas" podcast, Author of "Emergence: Luctor et Emergo", a philosophilcally inspired urban crime novel; and "The Melting Pot: A Canadian Guide to Cooking & Nutrition for managing chronic health conditions"; singer/song-writer/producer of the feature-length LP hip-hop album "Emergence: Luctor et Emergo".

- 👀 I’m a formerly FOREX investment banker and Flash developer - currently freelancing web developer (HTML / CSS / React), abstract static graphics designer selling royalty-free commercial use liceses of my graphics packs; Blender 3D modelling artist / animator, market analyst and political activist.
