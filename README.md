UPDATE 07/2025: !!!ATTENTION!!! Very important project called "KriSYS" that I just started. I would love to get some help with. Disaster relief, warzones, any crisis could make good use of a blockchain p2p messaging system so that warnings and alerts could be issued even when areas are without wifi or cell connection. With checkin stations, aid, and family tracking to help aid distribution, reunite victims when separated, and maintain more accurate records of disasters live while allowing families abroad to check in on the movements and live ongoings of crises as they're unravelling. This project would be a tremendous help to the world so I hope that you can find some way to chip in for this cause. - Kris

UPDATE 04/2022: Starting a youTube channel of the same name "paxdriver" to begin a development vlog chasing the proverbial dragon of achieving machine learning general artificial intelligence. Although the goal may be lofty, the approach itself is the primary focus of my research. I'll be using 3D graphics engines to develop, train and analyze implementations on my AI algorithm. I'll be posting samples of progress and teaching materials to this github so be on the lookout for supporting documentation linked from the youtube channel once I start posting videos.
